    "**Classical molecular dynamics** (MD) is a common computational chemistry technique for studying complex systems, such as proteins, polymers, and battery materials [1-4].\n",
    "Alongside the interest in these and other applications, molecular dynamics is also a used to help analyse data obtained from elastic scattering instruments. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial has been written to **introduce users of elastic-scattering techniques**, such as small angle scattering or diffraction, to classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.\n",
    "We hope that this tutorial can provide an accessible route for experimental researchers to **better understand some of the complexities and subtleties  of MD simulation**, thereby helping these researchers to get more relevant information from their simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial begins with an introduction to classical simulation methods, including a discussion of the development and parameterisation of classical interatomic potential models. \n",
    "We then provide an outline of traditional molecular dynamics simulation methods and discuss a number of important considerations users of MD simulation should be aware of. \n",
    "We close this tutorial with an illustrative practical example, using the [open-source Lennard-Jones simulation package `pylj`](https://doi.org/10.21105/jose.00019) [5], and discuss how a radially averaged scattering profile may be obtained **directly from simulation** via the Debye equation [6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to emphasise that this tutorial is in **no way** a complete course on molecular dynamics, and would direct the interested reader to one of the many detailed textbooks on this subject [7-11]. \n",
    "Rather, it is our hope that this tutorial provides a simple, practical, **general introduction to new, or future, users of MD methods within the scattering community**."

    "* The ability to run [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org). We recommend the Jupyter functionality within the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "This tutorial has been written to be an interactive learning experience, with you, the reader, writing and executing code alongside our instructions. \n",
    "Before starting the practical side of this tutorial, it is necessary to ensure that your computer is set up correctly. \n",
    "The next set of instructions assume that you want to the Jupyter Notebook application provided within the Anaconda distribution \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.org/download/). We recommend the Python 3.x version. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Having installed Anaconda, we recommend creating a `conda` environment to run this tutorial in. To do so, open a Terminal window (macOS or linux) or the anaconda prompt (Windows) and run the following command (this step only needs to be preformed once). \n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    conda create -n tutorial python \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Next we must access the environment using the following command.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    source activate tutorial \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Then install some packages for necessary for the tutorial.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    pip install sim-and-scat     \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Having set up the `conda` enivornment, all that is left to do in terms of getting started is to launch the Notebook.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    jupyter notebook \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "This means that you can now navigate within your files and open a new, clean Jupyter Notebook for use alongside this course. \n",
    "The new clean notebook may be opened by clicking 'New' and then 'Python 3'.\n",
    "Using this clean notebook, it is possible to run the interactive elements of each episode, either by copy and pasting or typing out the code in each of the `code block` cells (an example of which is shown below). "
